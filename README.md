The project aims to build a Web3 wallet enhanced with Authy-like Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) two-factor authentication for transaction approval, integrating zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) for privacy-preserving verification. This novel wallet leverages ERC-4337 account abstraction to require users to prove possession of a valid TOTP code without exposing the secret on-chain. By combining ZK circuit proofs and smart contract validation, users get bank-grade transaction-level 2FA embedded natively, improving security and user experience simultaneously. The client generates ZK proofs to validate TOTP codes based on synchronized timestamps, while the smart contract enforces proof validity and prevents replay attacks, all without storing private keys on-chain. This solution bridges Web2-style 2FA usability with Web3 self-custody and privacy, offering a practical, scalable, and secure wallet architecture for decentralized applications.
