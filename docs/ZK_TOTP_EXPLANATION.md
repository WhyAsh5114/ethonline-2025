# Zero-Knowledge TOTP Wallet - Complete ELI5 Guide üéì

A comprehensive, step-by-step explanation of how our ZK-TOTP smart contract wallet works.

---

## Part 1: The Basic Problem We're Solving üîê

### What is a Smart Contract Wallet?

**Normal Wallet (like MetaMask):**
```
You have a private key ‚Üí Signs transactions ‚Üí Blockchain accepts
```
- If you lose the key, your money is gone forever
- No extra security features

**Smart Contract Wallet (what we built):**
```
You have a private key + TOTP secret ‚Üí Smart contract checks both ‚Üí Blockchain accepts
```
- Can add extra security rules
- Can recover access
- Can have features like 2FA

---

## Part 2: What is TOTP? üì±

**TOTP = Time-based One-Time Password**

Think of Google Authenticator:
1. You scan a QR code (that's the "secret")
2. Your phone shows a 6-digit code
3. The code changes every 30 seconds
4. You type it into the website to log in

### How TOTP Works (Simple Version):

```
Secret + Current Time ‚Üí Magic Math ‚Üí 6-digit code

Example:
Secret: 12345
Time: 1729353600 seconds (October 19, 2025)
Time Window: 1729353600 √∑ 30 = 57645120

TOTP Code = special_math(12345, 57645120) = 586413
```

**Key Points:**
- The **secret** never changes (like a password)
- The **time** changes every second
- The **code** changes every 30 seconds
- Anyone with the same secret + time gets the same code

---

## Part 3: The Basic Security Problem üö®

### Problem 1: Secrets on the Blockchain

**Bad Idea:**
```
User ‚Üí Sends secret (12345) to blockchain
Everyone can see blockchain data!
Anyone can steal your secret!
```

### Problem 2: Public TOTP Codes

**Still Bad:**
```
User ‚Üí Sends TOTP code (586413) to blockchain
Code is visible for 30 seconds
Someone could copy and use it quickly!
```

---

## Part 4: What are Zero-Knowledge Proofs? üé≠

### The Magic Trick

**Zero-Knowledge Proof lets you prove you know a secret WITHOUT revealing it.**

### Real-World Analogy: The Colorblind Friend

Imagine:
- You have two balls: one red, one green
- Your friend is colorblind (can't tell them apart)
- You want to prove they're different colors without saying which is which

**The Proof:**
1. Friend holds one ball in each hand behind their back
2. Friend switches them (or doesn't) randomly
3. You tell if they switched
4. Repeat 20 times
5. You're right every time = They must be different colors!

**You proved it without revealing which color is which!**

### In Our Case:

**Traditional way:**
```
"My password is 12345" ‚ùå (everyone sees it)
```

**Zero-Knowledge way:**
```
"I can prove I know the password that hashes to XYZ, 
and that password generates TOTP code 586413 right now" ‚úÖ
(Nobody learns the password!)
```

---

## Part 5: The Components üß©

Let me explain each piece we built:

### 5.1: The Circuit (totp_verifier.circom)

**Think of it as a math puzzle template.**

```circom
// This is like saying: "To solve this puzzle, you must..."
template TOTPVerifier() {
    // Private inputs (only you know):
    signal input secret;
    
    // Public inputs (everyone can see):
    signal input totpCode;
    signal input timeCounter;
    signal input secretHash;
    
    // The rules:
    // Rule 1: Your secret must hash to the public secretHash
    component hasher = Poseidon(1);
    hasher.inputs[0] <== secret;
    hasher.out === secretHash;
    
    // Rule 2: Your secret + time must generate the TOTP code
    component totpHasher = Poseidon(2);
    totpHasher.inputs[0] <== secret;
    totpHasher.inputs[1] <== timeCounter;
    // ...math to check TOTP code...
}
```

**In plain English:**
"I will check that you know a secret that:
1. Hashes to this specific value
2. Generates this specific TOTP code at this time
3. BUT I won't reveal what the secret actually is!"

---

### 5.2: Poseidon Hash Function

**What is a hash function?**

It's like a one-way food processor:
```
Input: "hello" ‚Üí Hash Function ‚Üí Output: 5d41402abc...
Input: "hello" ‚Üí Hash Function ‚Üí Output: 5d41402abc... (same!)
Input: "helo"  ‚Üí Hash Function ‚Üí Output: a8f4c9e... (totally different!)
```

**Properties:**
1. ‚úÖ Same input always gives same output
2. ‚úÖ Can't reverse it (can't get "hello" from the hash)
3. ‚úÖ Tiny change in input = completely different output

**Why Poseidon specifically?**
- Regular hash (like SHA-256) is slow in ZK circuits
- Poseidon is designed to be fast in ZK circuits
- It's "ZK-friendly"

---

### 5.3: The Proving and Verification Keys

When we ran the setup script, we created two keys:

**Proving Key:**
- Like a stamp maker
- You use it to create proofs
- Kept by the user

**Verification Key:**
- Like a stamp checker
- Anyone can use it to verify proofs
- Put in the smart contract

**The "Trusted Setup Ceremony":**
```
1. Download Powers of Tau (community-generated randomness)
2. Generate initial proving key
3. Add our own randomness
4. Create final proving key + verification key
5. Export to Solidity contract
```

This ensures nobody can create fake proofs!

---

## Part 6: How a Proof is Generated üî®

Let's walk through what happens when you want to prove you know your TOTP:

### Step 1: You Have (Private, on your device):
```
Secret: 12345
Current time: 1729353600
```

### Step 2: Calculate (Still private):
```
Time counter: 1729353600 √∑ 30 = 57645120
TOTP code: Poseidon(12345, 57645120) % 1000000 = 586413
Secret hash: Poseidon(12345) = 42675337744...
```

### Step 3: Create the Proof (Using snarkjs):
```javascript
// Your inputs
const input = {
  secret: "12345",              // Private!
  totpCode: "586413",           // Public
  timeCounter: "57645120",      // Public
  secretHash: "42675337744..."  // Public
};

// Generate proof
const { proof, publicSignals } = await snarkjs.groth16.fullProve(
  input,
  wasmFile,    // Circuit compiled to WebAssembly
  zkeyFile     // Proving key
);
```

### Step 4: What You Get:
```javascript
proof = {
  pA: [big number, big number],        // Part 1 of proof
  pB: [[big, big], [big, big]],        // Part 2 of proof
  pC: [big number, big number]         // Part 3 of proof
}

publicSignals = [
  586413,           // The TOTP code
  57645120,         // The time counter
  42675337744...    // The secret hash
]
```

### Step 5: Send to Blockchain:
```
You send: proof + publicSignals
You DON'T send: secret (12345) ‚Üê This never leaves your device!
```

---

## Part 7: How the Proof is Verified ‚úÖ

On the blockchain, the smart contract does this:

### Step 1: Check Secret Hash
```solidity
// Is this YOUR secret?
if (publicSignals[2] != ownerSecretHash) {
    revert("Not your secret!");
}
```

### Step 2: Check Timestamp
```solidity
// Is the time fresh? (not too old, not future)
uint256 timestamp = publicSignals[1] * 30;
if (timestamp too old OR timestamp in future) {
    revert("Bad timestamp!");
}
```

### Step 3: Verify the Cryptographic Proof
```solidity
// This is the magic! The verifier contract checks:
// "Does this proof mathematically prove that someone knows
//  a secret that hashes to publicSignals[2] and generates
//  TOTP code publicSignals[0] at time publicSignals[1]?"

bool isValid = _verifier.verifyProof(pA, pB, pC, publicSignals);
if (!isValid) {
    revert("Invalid proof!");
}
```

### What the Verifier Actually Does (Simplified):

The verifier checks mathematical equations like:
```
e(pA, pB) = e(pC, [gamma]) * e([publicInput], [delta])
```

Where `e()` is a special "pairing" function. If this equation is true, the proof is valid!

**The magic:** This equation can only be true if you actually know the secret!

---

## Part 8: The Complete Flow üîÑ

Let me show you the entire process:

### Setup Phase (One Time):

```
1. You generate a TOTP secret: 12345
2. You calculate secretHash: Poseidon(12345) = 42675...
3. You deploy TOTPWallet contract with your secretHash
4. Your wallet is now protected!
```

### Using Your Wallet (Every Transaction):

```
Step 1: Your Device
‚îú‚îÄ Get current time: 1729353600
‚îú‚îÄ Calculate TOTP: 586413
‚îú‚îÄ Generate ZK proof (secret stays on device!)
‚îî‚îÄ Get: proof + [586413, 57645120, 42675...]

Step 2: Send to Blockchain
‚îú‚îÄ Transaction includes: proof + public signals
‚îî‚îÄ Does NOT include: secret (12345)

Step 3: Smart Contract Checks
‚îú‚îÄ ‚úì Is secretHash yours? (42675... == stored hash?)
‚îú‚îÄ ‚úì Is timestamp fresh? (within 5 minutes?)
‚îî‚îÄ ‚úì Is proof valid? (cryptographic verification)

Step 4: If All Pass
‚îî‚îÄ ‚úì Transaction executes!
```

---

## Part 9: Why This is Secure üîí

### Attack Scenario 1: "I'll copy the TOTP code from the blockchain!"

```
Attacker sees on blockchain:
- TOTP code: 586413
- Time counter: 57645120  
- Secret hash: 42675...

Attacker tries to use it:
‚ùå Code expires in 30 seconds
‚ùå Attacker's secret is different, so their secretHash ‚â† 42675...
‚ùå Contract rejects: "SecretHashMismatch!"
```

### Attack Scenario 2: "I'll intercept and replay the proof immediately!"

```
Attacker intercepts proof in real-time:
- TOTP code: 586413
- Time counter: 57645120
- Proof: (pA, pB, pC)

User submits first ‚Üí Contract marks timeCounter 57645120 as USED
Attacker tries to replay ‚Üí Contract checks:
  if (57645120 <= lastUsedTimeCounter) revert TimeCounterAlreadyUsed();
‚ùå Contract rejects: "TimeCounterAlreadyUsed!"
‚ùå Proof is ONE-TIME USE - worthless after first submission!
```

**Key Protection:** The contract tracks `lastUsedTimeCounter` and only accepts strictly increasing time windows. Even within the 5-minute freshness window, each proof can only be used ONCE.

### Attack Scenario 3: "I'll try to crack the secret from the hash!"

```
Attacker has: secretHash = 42675...
Attacker wants: secret = ?

Problem:
- Poseidon hash is one-way
- Would need to try EVERY possible secret
- If secret is long enough (like 128 bits):
  ‚Üí Would take longer than age of universe
‚ùå Not feasible!
```

### Attack Scenario 4: "I'll generate my own proof with my own secret!"

```
Attacker generates proof with their secret: 99999
Their proof includes secretHash: Poseidon(99999) = 88888...

Contract checks:
- Stored owner secretHash: 42675...
- Attacker's secretHash: 88888...
- 42675... ‚â† 88888...
‚ùå Contract rejects: "SecretHashMismatch!"
```

## Part 10: The Key Innovation üí°

### Traditional 2FA on Blockchain (Impossible):

```
‚ùå Can't send secret to blockchain (everyone sees it)
‚ùå Can't send TOTP directly (can be copied and replayed)
‚ùå Can't trust server (defeats purpose of blockchain)
```

### Our ZK-TOTP Solution:

```
‚úÖ Secret never leaves your device
‚úÖ Proof proves you know the secret
‚úÖ Each wallet tied to one secret (secretHash check)
‚úÖ Fully on-chain, no trusted servers
‚úÖ TOTP codes can be seen but are useless without the secret
‚úÖ Each proof is ONE-TIME USE (replay protection via timeCounter tracking)
‚úÖ Time-based expiration (30-second windows + 5-minute max freshness)
```

**What it is:** The rules/logic for TOTP verification  
**What it does:** Defines what makes a valid proof  
**Language:** Circom (special language for ZK circuits)

---

## Part 12: Common Questions ü§î

### Q: "If the TOTP code is public, why use ZK at all?"

**A:** The TOTP code alone isn't enough! You also need to prove you know the SECRET that generated it. ZK lets you prove you know the secret without revealing it.

### Q: "Why not just send a hash of the secret?"

**A:** Because:
1. Hash alone doesn't prove you can generate the current TOTP code
2. The hash would be the same every time (no time-based security)
3. ZK proof binds the secret to the current time AND the TOTP code

### Q: "What if someone tries a billion different secrets?"

**A:** They would need to try every possible secret until they find one where:
```
Poseidon(secret) == your stored secretHash
```
With a 128-bit secret, this would take trillions of years.

### Q: "Can I change my TOTP secret?"

**A:** Yes! We added the `updateSecretHash()` function. Just call it with your new secret's hash.

### Q: "What happens if I lose my secret?"

**A:** You can transfer ownership of the wallet to a new address, then set up a new secret. The wallet owner has full control.

## Technical Deep Dives (Optional Reading)

### How Groth16 Proof System Works

Groth16 is a specific type of zk-SNARK (Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge):

**Key Properties:**
- **Succinct:** Proofs are tiny (~200 bytes)
- **Non-Interactive:** No back-and-forth needed
- **Fast Verification:** Takes milliseconds on-chain

**The Math (Very Simplified):**
1. Circuit gets compiled to R1CS (Rank-1 Constraint System)
2. R1CS is a system of equations that must be satisfied
3. Proof shows you know values that satisfy all equations
4. Verifier checks equations using elliptic curve pairings

### How the Circuit Compilation Works

```
Circom Source Code (totp_verifier.circom)
    ‚Üì
Compiler (circom)
    ‚Üì
R1CS (mathematical constraints)
    ‚Üì
Witness Generator (WASM)
    ‚Üì
Proving Key Generation (snarkjs + Powers of Tau)
    ‚Üì
Solidity Verifier Contract
```

### Why We Need Powers of Tau

The "trusted setup" requires randomness that nobody knows:
- Community generates it through a multi-party ceremony
- As long as ONE participant is honest, it's secure
- Powers of Tau 28 was generated by hundreds of participants
- It's the "toxic waste" that must be destroyed

---

## Real-World Usage Example

Here's how a user would actually use this wallet:

### 1. Initial Setup
```javascript
// Generate a random TOTP secret
const secret = generateRandomSecret(); // e.g., "a8f3c9e2b1d4..."

// Calculate the secret hash
const secretHash = await calculateSecretHash(secret);

// Deploy wallet with your secret hash
const wallet = await deployWallet(entryPoint, verifier, owner, secretHash);

// Save your secret in your authenticator app
saveToAuthenticatorApp(secret);
```

### 2. Making a Transaction
```javascript
// Get current TOTP code from your phone
const totpCode = getFromAuthenticatorApp(); // "586413"

// Get current time
const timestamp = Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000);

// Generate ZK proof
const proof = await generateTOTPProof(secret, timestamp);

// Send transaction
await wallet.executeWithProof(
  proof.pA,
  proof.pB, 
  proof.pC,
  proof.publicSignals,
  targetAddress,
  value,
  data
);
```

### 3. Rotating Your Secret
```javascript
// Generate new secret
const newSecret = generateRandomSecret();
const newSecretHash = await calculateSecretHash(newSecret);

// Update in contract (requires old secret to prove it's you)
const proof = await generateTOTPProof(oldSecret, timestamp);
await wallet.updateSecretHash(newSecretHash, proof);

// Update your authenticator app
updateAuthenticatorApp(newSecret);
```

---

## Security Considerations

### What We Protect Against:
‚úÖ Secret theft (never on-chain)  
‚úÖ TOTP code replay attacks (timestamp freshness)  
‚úÖ Unauthorized access (secretHash binding)  
‚úÖ Brute force attacks (cryptographic security)

### What We Don't Protect Against:
‚ùå Device compromise (if attacker gets your secret from your device)  
‚ùå Physical access to your authenticator  
‚ùå Quantum computers (current ZK systems aren't quantum-resistant)  
‚ùå Smart contract bugs (requires auditing)

### Best Practices:
1. Use a strong random secret (128+ bits)
2. Keep your secret secure (encrypted storage)
3. Rotate secrets periodically
4. Use additional authentication layers if needed
5. Audit smart contracts before mainnet deployment

---

## Performance Metrics

### Proof Generation (Off-Chain):
- Time: ~1-2 seconds
- Memory: ~500MB
- Size: ~200 bytes

### Proof Verification (On-Chain):
- Gas Cost: ~300,000 gas
- Time: Milliseconds
- Cost: Depends on gas prices

### Circuit Complexity:
- Constraints: 969 total (492 non-linear, 477 linear)
- Template Instances: 144
- Public Inputs: 3
- Private Inputs: 1

---

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements to the system:

1. **Batch Verification:** Verify multiple proofs in one transaction
2. **Recursive Proofs:** Prove you verified a proof (for scaling)
3. **Hardware Wallet Integration:** Generate proofs on secure hardware
4. **Social Recovery:** Add backup recovery mechanisms
5. **Multi-Factor:** Combine with other authentication methods
6. **Mobile App:** User-friendly proof generation app
7. **Gas Optimization:** Reduce verification gas costs
8. **Quantum Resistance:** Upgrade to post-quantum ZK systems

## Understanding TOTPVerifier.sol üî¢

### What is This Contract?

`TOTPVerifier.sol` is **auto-generated** by snarkjs from your circuit. It's basically the "stamp checker" we talked about earlier - the on-chain verifier that can check if a proof is valid **without** needing to know your secret.

### Why So Many Random Numbers?

Those aren't random at all! They're **cryptographic constants** that encode your verification key. Let me break down what each group of numbers represents:

#### 1. Field Sizes (Lines 24-26)
```solidity
uint256 constant r = 21888242871839275222246405745257275088548364400416034343698204186575808495617;
uint256 constant q = 21888242871839275222246405745257275088696311157297823662689037894645226208583;
```

**What they are:**
- `r` = The **scalar field** size (for regular numbers in the proof)
- `q` = The **base field** size (for elliptic curve points)

**Why these specific numbers?**
- These are prime numbers that define the BN254 elliptic curve
- BN254 is the curve used by Groth16 (the ZK proof system)
- Think of them as the "universe size" for the math - all calculations happen modulo these numbers

**Real-world analogy:**
It's like saying "we're doing clock arithmetic, but instead of 12 hours, our clock has 21888... hours."

#### 2. Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta (Lines 29-43)

```solidity
uint256 constant alphax  = 20491192805390485299153009773594534940189261866228447918068658471970481763042;

// ... and so on
```

**What they are:**
These are **elliptic curve points** that form your verification key. Each point has:
- An x-coordinate (and sometimes x1, x2 for pairing-friendly curves)
- A y-coordinate (and sometimes y1, y2)

**Where they come from:**
During the trusted setup (`setup.ts`), random values were generated and these points were computed. They're unique to YOUR circuit!

**What they do:**
These points are used in the pairing check equation:
```
e(A, B) = e(alpha, beta) * e(vk_x, gamma) * e(C, delta)
```

If this equation is true, the proof is valid!

**Why the weird names?**
- **Alpha & Beta:** Reference points from the trusted setup
- **Gamma:** Related to public inputs
- **Delta:** Related to private witness values

#### 3. IC Points (Lines 46-57)

```solidity
uint256 constant IC0x = 12327518999218128949174182902641399630388909486994255097834260668037535126192;
uint256 constant IC0y = 5768017857041062466506786892138928803447850739514422791162444830381301206210;
uint256 constant IC1x = 15154987824575257906720218690408339065835103741642936301391289746703104119579;
// ...
```

**What they are:**
IC = "Input Coefficients" - one point for each public input + 1 base point.

You have **4 IC points** (IC0, IC1, IC2, IC3) because:
- IC0 = Base point
- IC1 = Coefficient for public input #1 (totpCode)
- IC2 = Coefficient for public input #2 (timeCounter)  
- IC3 = Coefficient for public input #3 (secretHash)

**What they do:**
They create a "linear combination" of your public inputs:
```
vk_x = IC0 + (IC1 * totpCode) + (IC2 * timeCounter) + (IC3 * secretHash)
```

This combines all your public inputs into a single elliptic curve point that goes into the pairing check!

### The Verification Algorithm

Now let's understand what happens when `verifyProof()` is called:

#### Step 1: Validate Inputs (Lines 175-180)
```solidity
checkField(calldataload(add(_pubSignals, 0)))    // Check totpCode < r
checkField(calldataload(add(_pubSignals, 32)))   // Check timeCounter < r
checkField(calldataload(add(_pubSignals, 64)))   // Check secretHash < r
```

Makes sure all public inputs are valid field elements (not too big).

#### Step 2: Compute Linear Combination (Lines 114-120)
```solidity
mstore(_pVk, IC0x)
mstore(add(_pVk, 32), IC0y)

g1_mulAccC(_pVk, IC1x, IC1y, calldataload(add(pubSignals, 0)))
g1_mulAccC(_pVk, IC2x, IC2y, calldataload(add(pubSignals, 32)))
g1_mulAccC(_pVk, IC3x, IC3y, calldataload(add(pubSignals, 64)))
```

This computes:
```
vk_x = IC0 + (totpCode * IC1) + (timeCounter * IC2) + (secretHash * IC3)
```

#### Step 3: Prepare Pairing Inputs (Lines 123-166)

Sets up 4 pairs of elliptic curve points:
1. `(-A, B)` - From your proof
2. `(alpha, beta)` - From verification key
3. `(vk_x, gamma)` - Computed from public inputs + verification key
4. `(C, delta)` - From your proof + verification key

#### Step 4: The Magic Pairing Check (Line 169)
```solidity
success := staticcall(sub(gas(), 2000), 8, _pPairing, 768, _pPairing, 0x20)
```

This calls precompiled contract #8 (the BN254 pairing function) which checks:
```
e(-A, B) * e(alpha, beta) * e(vk_x, gamma) * e(C, delta) = 1
```

**If this equation is true ‚Üí Proof is valid! ‚úÖ**

### Why Use Assembly?

You might notice the entire function is in `assembly { ... }`. This is because:

1. **Gas Optimization:** Assembly is way more gas-efficient
2. **Precise Control:** Needs exact control over memory layout
3. **Precompiled Contracts:** Calls special Ethereum precompiles (contracts 6, 7, 8)
   - Contract 6: Elliptic curve addition
   - Contract 7: Elliptic curve scalar multiplication  
   - Contract 8: BN254 pairing check

### The Pairing Function Explained (ELI5)

**Pairing** is a special function that takes two elliptic curve points and outputs a number:
```
e(Point1, Point2) = Number
```

**Special Property:**
```
e(a*P, b*Q) = e(P, Q)^(a*b)
```

This property is what makes ZK proofs work! It lets the verifier check relationships between values without knowing the values themselves.

**Analogy:**
Imagine a magic function where:
- You put in two colored balls
- It outputs a specific smell
- If the balls have the right relationship, all the smells multiply together to give "no smell" (neutral)
- The verifier checks if smell1 * smell2 * smell3 * smell4 = neutral

### Where Do These Numbers Come From?

When you ran `pnpm run setup` in the circuits directory:

```typescript
// 1. Compile circuit ‚Üí R1CS constraints
circom compile

// 2. Generate proving key (includes toxic waste)
snarkjs groth16 setup

// 3. Contribute randomness (destroys toxic waste)
snarkjs zkey contribute

// 4. Extract verification key
snarkjs zkey export verificationkey

// 5. Generate this Solidity contract!
snarkjs zkey export solidityverifier
```

The numbers are computed from:
- Your circuit's constraints
- The Powers of Tau randomness
- Your personal contribution

### Can You Change These Numbers?

**No!** These numbers are cryptographically tied to:
1. Your specific circuit (totp_verifier.circom)
2. The trusted setup randomness
3. Your contribution

If you change your circuit even slightly, you need to regenerate everything!

### Security Implications

**Why these specific numbers matter:**

1. **Uniqueness:** These numbers are unique to YOUR circuit
2. **Binding:** They mathematically bind to your circuit's logic
3. **Soundness:** Wrong proofs won't satisfy the pairing equation
4. **Zero-Knowledge:** The numbers don't reveal anything about valid witnesses

**What if someone tampers with them?**
- If you change any number, verification will fail for ALL proofs (including valid ones)
- If an attacker tries to use different numbers, their proofs won't verify
- The contract would just break

### Testing the Verifier

You can see it in action in your tests:

```typescript
// In TOTPWallet.ts
const verifier = await viem.deployContract("TOTPVerifier");

// Later...
const isValid = await verifier.read.verifyProof([
  proof.pA,           // Point A from proof
  proof.pB,           // Point B from proof
  proof.pC,           // Point C from proof
  publicSignals       // [totpCode, timeCounter, secretHash]
]);
// Returns true if pairing equation holds!
```

### Common Questions

**Q: Can I simplify this contract?**  
A: No, every line is mathematically necessary. It's already optimized by snarkjs.

**Q: Why not just trust a server to verify?**  
A: That defeats the purpose! On-chain verification means it's trustless and decentralized.

**Q: How does Ethereum know how to do pairings?**  
A: Ethereum has built-in precompiled contracts (at addresses 6, 7, 8) that do elliptic curve math efficiently.

**Q: What if I want to verify a different circuit?**  
A: You'd need a different verifier contract with different numbers, generated from that circuit.

**Q: Are these numbers secret?**  
A: No! They're public. The security comes from the mathematical impossibility of creating valid proofs without knowing the witness (your secret).
